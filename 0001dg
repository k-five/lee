Difficult Customer
Good evening. My name? is Fabio, I’ll be your waiter for tonight. May I take your order?
No, I’m still working on it. This menu is not even in English. What’s good here?


For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.
Does it come with coke and fries?


It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, Sir.
I’ll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.


Excellent choice, your order will be ready soon.
How soon is soon?
Twenty minutes?
You know what? I’ll just go grab a burger across the street
